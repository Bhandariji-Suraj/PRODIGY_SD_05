# Task 5: Web Scraping.

In this task, I developed a web scraping program that extracts product information, such as names, prices, and ratings, from an online e-commerce website and stores the data in a structured format like a CSV file.

## Technologies used: 

Python, BeautifulSoup, requests, CSV

## Key learnings: 

While writing the program, I was able to learn many new things, such as:

1. Web Scraping Fundamentals: Gained a solid understanding of web scraping techniques and how to interact with web pages programmatically.
2. HTML Parsing: Learned how to parse and navigate HTML documents to extract specific data elements using BeautifulSoup.
3. HTTP Requests: Improved knowledge of making HTTP requests and handling responses using the requests library.
4. Data Storage: Learned how to structure and store extracted data in a CSV file for easy analysis and further use.
5. Ethical Considerations: Understood the importance of respecting website terms of service and ethical guidelines while scraping data.
